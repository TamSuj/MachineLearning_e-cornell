# World Happiness Report (WHR) Prediction Project

## Data Set
World Happiness Report (WHR) data set: WHR2018Chapter2OnlineData.csv

## Prediction Target
Predicting the "Life ladder" column.

## Problem Type
Regression problem. The goal is to predict the numerical value of "life ladder."

## Importance of the Problem
Predicting the happiness index can offer valuable insights to companies and governments. Companies can identify potential markets for products that enhance well-being and better support their employees' welfare. Moreover, informed investment decisions can be made based on the stability and well-being of a country.

## Project Plan
- Features chosen: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, and generosity.
- Models to consider: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Bagging (ensemble method).
- Data preparation techniques: Feature selection, removal of null value rows, data split (60-20-20 training-testing-validation).
- Evaluation metric: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Training plan: Train and validate models, analyze performance, fine-tune hyperparameters.
- Model improvement: Iterate and experiment with hyperparameters for better accuracy.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the WHR dataset (WHR2018Chapter2OnlineData.csv).
3. Install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
4. Run the notebook/script to train, validate, and test the models.
5. Analyze the results and iterate for model improvement.

## Conclusion
Predicting the happiness index using machine learning models can have significant applications in business and investment decisions. By accurately predicting well-being, companies can tailor their strategies to promote and enhance happiness in various aspects of society.
